# Fan_NFT

*I reorganized the file structure. Below I put some useful links as well as my login info for a threejs course*

## TODO
* Export Function
  * Get all fan props
  * Assemble props into a fan
  * Package so it can be shipped

* Setup Hardhat/Truffle/Openzepplin (leaning towards hardhat per the eth website)
  * Step 8: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-an-nft/

* Test on Ropsten Test Network (maybe do this with some dummy nft's)

* Create more designs for handle/leaf

* Handle Adjustments
  * It's too think
  * Add a Tastle?
  * Add an inner section?
  * Add a section on top, thinner than the base

* Leaf Adjustments
  * Experiment with making the body empty
  * Make the skeleton (wireframe) less prominent

* Ideas
  * Leaf shape could be cool to implement
  * Make backgrounds interact with handle reflection/refraction
  * Play with lights
    * Ambient light may be too bright
    * Add another directional light to highlight fan more
